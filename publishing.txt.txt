* commit and push to the main repo, this will trigger appveyor. Collect the artifacts manually and put them in the folder dist.
* go to pyreadr_wheels2, git rm the folder wheels
* in pyreadr_wheels2, change .travis.yml changing the commit to the current one, commit and push. This will trigger the 
  travis job that will start introducing commits with one wheel per commit. It also triggers appveyor which will fail, but that's ok.
  If a job fails, go to travis and restart it. 
* in pyreadr_wheels2, git pull the folder wheels will now have the wheels, copy and paste into the folder dist of pyreadr.
* in pyreadr produce the source distribution which goes into dist.
* upload to pypi using twine
